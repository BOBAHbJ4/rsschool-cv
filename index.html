          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <article class="cv-article">
            I graduated from the Grodno State Agrarian University with a degree in economic (by specialty
            “economist - manager"). Currently, I’m a junior Developer. I have been studying JavaScript and English myself
            over the year. I finished a course on Web application Development in JavaScript in the educational center
            High Technology Park. Was in the service team at the command center during European games 2019.
            <strong>My biggest strengths are that I’m able to keep deadlines successfully. I'm patient and versatile.
              I enjoy learning new things.</strong>
