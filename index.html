          <article class="cv-article">
            I graduated from the Grodno State Agrarian University with a degree in economic (by specialty
            “economist - manager"). Currently, I’m a junior Developer. I have been studying JavaScript and English myself
            over the year. I finished a course on Web application Development in JavaScript in the educational center
            High Technology Park. Was in the service team at the command center during European games 2019.
            <strong>My biggest strengths are that I’m able to keep deadlines successfully. I'm patient and versatile.
              I enjoy learning new things.</strong>

            <li><strong>Professional interests:</strong>
            <p>To improve my programming skills in my spare time, I wrote the dashboard + studying for a free online
              programming course from RSSchool;<br/>
              For a better understanding of the ATM's operation, I received additional training within the company using
              the NDC Protocol<br/>
              To improve the level of English, I attend courses organized by the company, and also independently read
              classical and modern literature in English

          <h2>Reason for applying for a job</h2>
          <article class="cv-article">
            I consider to be my biggest professional achievement improvement of my English and the fact that I was able
            to achieve certain results (for example, I was able to write a dashboard on my own and without help, adding
            markers and a legend to the map layer, and I was also able to connect a library of graphs to display
            the necessary information) in Web programming without programming experience.
            <strong>Nothing pleases me more in development than the end result</strong>, even if I have made a small contribution to the
            project, but I can see the result of my work and that works - it costs a lot.
